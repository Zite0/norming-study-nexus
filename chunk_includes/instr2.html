<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; You will be presented with an image that represents a verb. Consider the following image: 
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="verb_pulled.png" align="center">
</div></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; For the purposes of our experiment, we will only consider the verb itself. For example,
you would say out loud: <b>"pulled"</b>. We will explain more of this in the following pages. </p>
